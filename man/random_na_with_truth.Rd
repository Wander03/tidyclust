\title{Generate Dataframe with Random NAs and Corresponding Truth}
\usage{
random_na_with_truth(df, na_prob = 0.3)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{The input data frame to which \code{NA} values will be introduced.
It is typically a transactional dataset where columns are items and rows are transactions.}

\item{na_prob}{The probability (between 0 and 1) that any given cell in the
input data frame will be replaced with \code{NA}.}
}
\value{
A list containing two data frames:
\itemize{
\item \code{na_data}: The data frame with \code{NA} values randomly introduced.
\item \code{truth}: The original input data frame, serving as the ground truth.
}
}
\description{
This helper function creates a new data frame by randomly introducing \code{NA} values
into an input data frame. It also returns the original data frame as a "truth"
reference, which can be useful for simulating scenarios with missing data
for prediction tasks.
}
\examples{
# Create a sample data frame
sample_df <- data.frame(
  itemA = c(1, 0, 1),
  itemB = c(0, 1, 1),
  itemC = c(1, 1, 0)
)

# Generate NA data and truth with 30\% NA probability
set.seed(123)
na_data_list <- random_na_with_truth(sample_df, na_prob = 0.3)

# View the NA data
print(na_data_list$na_data)

# View the truth data
print(na_data_list$truth)

This function is not exported as it was used to test and provide examples in
the vignettes, it may be formally introduced in the future.
